/*
The React lifecycle: methods and hooks explained
including mounting, updating, and unmounting

1. mounting - 
new component is created and inserted into the DOM or, 
in other words, when the life of a component begins. 
This can only happen once, and is often called “initial render.”

2. The updating phase is when the component updates or re-renders. This reaction is triggered when the props are updated or when the state is updated. This phase can occur multiple times, which is kind of the point of React.
3. The last phase within a component's lifecycle is the unmounting phase, when the component is removed from the DOM.
